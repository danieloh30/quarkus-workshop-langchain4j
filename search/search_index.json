The workshop is divided into 2 sections. The first section is focused on building AI apps and has 11 steps. The second section focuses on building agentic workflows and has 4 steps. Each step builds on the previous one, adding new features and functionality.</p> <p>In each section, we start from the base functionality (step-01) and add features in the subsequent steps. The result after each step is located in a separate directory (<code>step-XX</code>). The final solution for <code>section-1</code> is in the <code>section-1/step-11</code> directory. The final solution for <code>section-2</code> is in the <code>section-2/step-04</code> directory.</p> <p>We recommend to start by checking out the main branch and then opening the project from <code>step-01</code> in your IDE and using that directory throughout the workshop. The other option is to make a copy of it. If you later need to reset to a particular step, either overwrite your working directory with the directory for the step you want to reset to, or, in your IDE, open the project from the step directory you want to reset to.</p> <p>Let\u2019s get started!</p>"},{"location":"conclusion-references/","title":"Conclusion references","text":""},{"location":"conclusion-references/#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"conclusion/","title":"Conclusion","text":""},{"location":"conclusion/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Alright, this is the end!

It uses a WebSocket, this is why you can also see the following dependency in the <code>pom.xml</code> file:</p> <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-websockets-next&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>If you now open the <code>src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/quarkus/workshop/CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket.java</code>  file, you can see how the web socket is implemented:</p> CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket.java<pre><code>package dev.langchain4j.quarkus.workshop;\n\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnOpen;\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnTextMessage;\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocket;\n\n@WebSocket(path = \"/customer-support-agent\")\npublic class CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket {\n\n    private final CustomerSupportAgent customerSupportAgent;\n\n    public CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket(CustomerSupportAgent customerSupportAgent) {\n        this.customerSupportAgent = customerSupportAgent;\n    }\n\n    @OnOpen\n    public String onOpen() {\n        return \"Welcome to Miles of Smiles!

An AI service is an object managed by the Quarkus LangChain4j extension. It models the interaction with the AI model. As you can see it\u2019s an interface, not a concrete class, so you don\u2019t need to implement anything (thanks Quarkus!). Quarkus LangChain4j will provide an implementation for you at build time. Thus, your application only interacts with the methods defined in the interface.</p> <p>There is a single method in this interface, <code>chat</code>, but you could name the method whatever you wanted. It takes a user message as input (as it\u2019s the only parameter, we consider it to be the user message) and returns the response from the AI model. How this is done is abstracted away by Quarkus LangChain4j.</p> <p><code>SessionScoped</code>?</p> <p>Attentive readers might have noticed the <code>@SessionScoped</code> annotation. This is a CDI annotation which scopes the object to the session. In our case the session is the web socket. The session starts when the user connects to the web socket and ends when the user disconnects. This annotation indicates that the <code>CustomerSupportAgent</code> object is created when the session starts and destroyed when the session ends. It influences the memory of our chatbot, as it remembers the conversation that happened so far in this session.</p> <p>So far, so good!

You then need to add a collector specific extension to format the metrics accordingly. In the below example we have included the <code>quarkus-micrometer-registry-otlp</code> extension for the general purpose OpenTelemetry. This extension imports the quarkus-micrometer as well, so no need to specify it implicitly.

Such as:</p> Example of some of the LangChain4j metrics<pre><code># HELP langchain4j_aiservices_seconds_max \n# TYPE langchain4j_aiservices_seconds_max gauge\nlangchain4j_aiservices_seconds_max{aiservice=\"CustomerSupportAgent\",method=\"chat\",} 0.0\nlangchain4j_aiservices_seconds_max{aiservice=\"PromptInjectionDetectionService\",method=\"isInjection\",} 0.0\n# HELP langchain4j_aiservices_seconds \n# TYPE langchain4j_aiservices_seconds summary\nlangchain4j_aiservices_seconds_count{aiservice=\"CustomerSupportAgent\",method=\"chat\",} 1.0\nlangchain4j_aiservices_seconds_sum{aiservice=\"CustomerSupportAgent\",method=\"chat\",} 2.485171837\nlangchain4j_aiservices_seconds_count{aiservice=\"PromptInjectionDetectionService\",method=\"isInjection\",} 1.0\nlangchain4j_aiservices_seconds_sum{aiservice=\"PromptInjectionDetectionService\",method=\"isInjection\",} 0.775163834\n</code></pre> <p>You can also customize the metrics collection by adding your own custom metrics.

It involves tracking the flow of requests and responses through your application, and identifying any anomalies or inconsistencies that may indicate a problem. It also allows you to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in your application. For example, you could track the amount of time it took to call the model, and identify any requests that took longer than expected. You can then tie these traces back to specific log entries or lines in your code.</p> <p>Tracing can also help you detect anomalies in the behavior of your application over time, such as a sudden increase in traffic or a drop in response times.</p> <p>Quarkus implements the OpenTelemetry project for tracing capabilities, allowing you to collect and analyze  trace data from your LangChain4j application. You can use the OpenTelemetry API to send traces to a tracing service such as Jaeger, Zipkin, or Tempo, which can then be used for monitoring and debugging purposes.</p> <p>To add OpenTelemetry (and by extension tracing) to your application, you will need to add the opentelemetry extensions to your pom.xml file.

If you have a tracing service running, you can set the endpoint accordingly. In a production environment you will likely override this value with an environment variable or ConfigMap or something similar.

By adding the <code>quarkus-observability-devservices-gtm</code> extension, this set of tools will automatically (or may we say \u2018automagically\u2019?) start up in their respective containers and wire up to your application\u2019s observability endpoints.</p> <p>Add the following dependencies in your <code>pom.xml</code>:</p> pom.xml<pre><code>        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-observability-devservices-lgtm&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In the application.properties, let\u2019s enable the OpenTelemetry tracing and log collection features:</p> <pre><code>quarkus.otel.logs.enabled=true\nquarkus.otel.traces.enabled=true\n# Disable LTGM in test mode\n%test.quarkus.observability.enabled=false\n</code></pre> <p>Now refresh the chatbot application in your browser and interact with the bot again to generate some new observability data. Note that it could take a bit longer for the application to start up, since Quarkus is starting up the LGTM Dev Services containers in the background.</p> <p>After you\u2019ve generated some data, let\u2019s go and explore this data in Grafana. The Dev Service exposes a random port. The easiest way to find it is to go to the Quarkus Dev UI (http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui) and click on the \u201cDev Services\u201d menu item.</p> <p></p> <p>Find the <code>grafana.endpoint</code> and open the url in another browser tab. Use admin/admin to log in if you need to.</p> <p>Let\u2019s first explore the provided custom metrics dashboards that the dev service creates. Go to \u201cDashboards\u201d in the left menu. You will notice 2 dashboards, one for OTLP and one for Prometheus. Remember how we added both the Micrometer OpenTelemetry and Prometheus registry extensions? They\u2019re both reflected here. Feel free to explore the dashboards. If you don\u2019t see much data data in the graphs, you may want to select a shorter time span in the top right of your screen and/or create some more chat requests.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also find an aggregation of all metrics (including the LangChain4j relevant ones) by going to Explore &gt; Metrics:</p> <p></p> <p>Now let\u2019s explore the Query functionality to find specific data. Click on the <code>Explore</code> menu item. An interactive query window will open up. Next to \u201cOutline\u201d you\u2019ll see that Prometheus is selected in the dropdown. Select <code>gen_ai_client_estimated_cost_total</code>. Then, in label filters, select <code>currency</code> and value <code>USD</code>. Finally, click the Run query button to see the results. You should see an estimated cost aggregation of the latest calls to the model. This is an experimental feature based on what typical calls to ChatGPT cost.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s now take a look at how we can get our traces from Tempo. In the same Query window next the \u201cOutline\u201d, select <code>Tempo</code> instead of Prometheus. Then, click on <code>Search</code> next to Query type. You will see a table appear below with a list of the latest trace IDs and the service they relate to.</p> <p></p> <p>Click on any one of the traces to open more details about them. You will see a list of spans that represent different parts of the request and response, and potentially also the database query, based on which trace you have selected. Go ahead and explore these traces and spans for a little while to get familiar with the data that\u2019s automatically tracked when enabling the OpenTelemetry extension. Make sure to also click on the <code>Node Graph</code> to see the flow of the request.</p> <p>Finally, expand one (or more) of the span elements. You will see details about a particular call in the code, and you\u2019ll also see a button \u201cLogs for this span\u201d. This allows you to see the logs related to that particular span. If you don\u2019t see any logs, try another span.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"section-1/step-10/#fault-tolerance","title":"Fault Tolerance","text":"<p>Thanks to the introduction of observability in our app we now have good insights into our application and if something goes wrong, we should (hopefully) be able to pinpoint the issue fairly quickly.</p> <p>While it\u2019s great that, if there\u2019s an issue, we can now retrieve a lot of details about our application, the user would still be affected and potentially get an ugly error message.</p> <p>In this next section, we\u2019re going to add Fault Tolerance to our application\u2019s LLM calls so that, should something go wrong, we are able to handle it gracefully.</p> <p>Ultimately, calling an LLM is not much different than making traditional REST calls.

As part of the protocol, agents defined in the server must provide an <code>AgentCard</code> which describes:</p> <ul> <li>The name and description of the agent</li> <li>The agent\u2019s capabilities (the parts of the A2A protocol it supports)</li> <li>The agent\u2019s skills (what the agent\u2019s purpose is)</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul> <p>A2A Agents must also implement an <code>AgentExecutor</code>. The A2A sdk calls the <code>AgentExecutor.execute</code> method when it wants to invoke your agent. Your implementation of the <code>AgentExecutor</code> interface is responsible for calling your agent (for example your LangChain4j AI service or Agent). The <code>AgentExecutor.execute</code> method has the following signature:</p> <pre><code>public void execute(RequestContext context, EventQueue eventQueue)\n</code></pre> <p>The execute method is invoked when a task or message needs to be handled.</p> <p>Tasks have unique IDs, have a state (submitted, working, input-required, auth-required, completed, canceled, failed, rejected or unknown), and can be referenced across requests to the A2A agent. As such, tasks are created for tracking ongoing work on a specific topic (eg. a hotel booking) that may not complete within a few seconds.</p> <p>Messages have unique IDs but no tracked state. They are good for short requests that do not require more context information than can be found in the recent message history.</p> <p>We will create a <code>DispositionAgent</code> to handle getting rid of cars, where each disposition of a car is a task.</p>"},{"location":"section-2/step-04/#what-are-we-going-to-build","title":"What are we going to build?","text":"<p>Our architecture includes 2 Quarkus runtimes \u2013 one running our agentic workflow (Quarkus runtime 1) and the other running the remote A2A agent (Quarkus runtime 2). </p>"},{"location":"section-2/step-04/#before-you-begin","title":"Before you begin","text":"<p>If you are continuing to build the app in the <code>step-01</code> directory, start by copying some files (which don\u2019t relate to the experience of building agentic AI apps) from <code>step-04</code>.
